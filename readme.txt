Read Me for Work Day Planner

HOW THE WORK DAY PLANNER FUNCTIONS:
The Work Day Planner is a simple app for planning your work day.  You can enter in a task for each hour and save that task to local storage.  
The task will remain in the page even upon refresh.  

During the work day, the current hour will be highlighted in green, so it will be simple
to determine what meeting or task is scheduled now.  Hours that have already past will be colored gray, and hours that are yet to occur will 
be colored blue.

MY CODING EXPERIENCE:
I initially started building the table for the Work Day Planner solely in the javascript file, but decided that is was easier
for me to build the table using HTML and code the data storage and interactivty in javascript.  

The classes in the CSS file were helpful in giving clues about how to write the javascript.  The past, present, and future classes made it easier to
figure out how to set up the colors for the times of day.

I hope you enjoy using this simple Work Day Planner!
